              <h2>Gaming</h2>
              <p>
                I play games, since I was a kid. My first PC gaming experience
                was with KOTOR-II. I love well written plots, and it has many
                good side stories. My Cousin showed me how I can cheat. It was
                funny and I was fascinated about how a some lines of text
                changes the game.
              </p>
              <p>
                Before high school I already played World of Warcraft: Wrath of
                the Lich King. The fantasy setting won my heart. There are many
                boring and repetitive tasks in wow, so I thought it would be
                cool to automate. But how the heck do I that? 2 weeks, many
                apples later I've learned how to make addons to the game. So I
                wrote my own rotation guide for holy paladin and mining node
                explorer. It was hard coded, and to be honest buggy, but I've
                made it and I had fun to learn LUA and playing WoW.
              </p>
              <p>
                In high school I've got lot of friends of the same interests. We
                played Age of Empires, Civ5, Counter Strike 1.6, League of
                Legends, Hearthstone, Call od Duty just to name a few. We had a
                lot of fun and I have friends from this time till today. In
                school I've learned CNC machining and machining in general. I
                was curious about how the digital control of these machines
                work, so I've learned C and with the help of teachers I could
                understand, how the system of a CNC machine works.
              </p>
              <p>
                Last year of high school (2016/17) with one of my friend, we did
                a patent in multi-nozzle 3D printing. (P1600235 ->
                http://epub.hpo.hu/e-kutatas/) I learned a lot about
                microcontrollers, mechatronics and programming in C and Python.
                And then, I decided to become a Mechatronics Engineer.
              </p>
              <p>
                Currently, I do gaming as a socializing activity. So if you
                would like to play LoL, Hunt:Showdown or just chat, hit me up on
                discord!
              </p>
              <h2>Dnd</h2>
              <p>
                At Uni, I've met lot of new friends. We mainly played
                boardgames. We terraformed Mars, conquered Westeros, built up
                the Seven Wonders, played with Unstable Unicorns and Booming
                Cats. Many many 6-7 hours game nights, and they were awesome!
                Every one of them.
              </p>
              <p>
                At some point we thought that, let's try out Dungeons and
                Dragons. And Boy, I glad we did it. If you want to live out your
                creativity in a fantasy setting, just play Dnd. Huge world,
                Endless lore, great plots, a journey with friends, and dragons.
              </p>
              <p>
                Since then I was GM, player and I have many characters in the
                world of Dungeons and Dragons. Currently, I play only as a
                player. I love mend the wounded, and help the weak, so I play
                the Cleric Class.
              </p>
              <h2>Workout</h2>
              <p>
                As a kid I did Judo, than in high school I played Volleyball.
                Most of my life I had 3-5 trainings a week. Currently I workout,
                only at home. I started Calestics about a year ago. It's fun and
                hard.
              </p>
              <p>
                I recommend to anyone, who want to have Strength, Stamina and
                better motoric Control. Keep drinking your water!
              </p>
              <h2>Guitar</h2>
              <p>
                In Elementary school I learned the basics, and then ever since
                I'd love to learn the guitar better. In heart I'm a guitarist
                wannabe, but I never got to the point, where I could call myself
                a musician.
              </p>
              <p>
                At some point in time i thought: It's time to change, so i learn
                every week at least 2 hours. My goal is to reach that level of
                skill, where i learn songs easily, not through memorizing every
                single note.
              </p>
              <p>
                If you have any tips, tricks or just would like to show off your
                skills you are very welcome !
